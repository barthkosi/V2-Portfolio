# Explrar: AI Trip Planner

**Explrar** is an application designed to take the stress out of travel planning. By leveraging AI, it helps users generate itineraries, organize documents, and discover new destinations.

## The Challenge

Travel planning is often fragmented. Users have to switch between booking sites, maps, notes, and email confirmations. We wanted to create a unified experience.

## The Solution

We built a centralized dashboard where users can manage every aspect of their trip. Key features include:

1.  **AI Itinerary Generation**: Just tell Explrar where you want to go and for how long.
2.  **Document Vault**: Securely store tickets and passports.
3.  **Collaborative Planning**: Invite friends to plan with you.

## The Tech Stack

*   React & Vite
*   Tailwind CSS for styling
*   OpenAI API for recommendations
*   Firebase for real-time collaboration

## Conclusion

Building Explrar taught us a lot about the intersection of AI and user experience design. The result is a tool that feels magical to use.
