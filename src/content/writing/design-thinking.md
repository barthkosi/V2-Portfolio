# The Art of Design Thinking

Design thinking is more than just a buzzword; it's a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test.

## Phases of Design Thinking

1.  **Empathize**: Research your users' needs.
2.  **Define**: State your users' needs and problems.
3.  **Ideate**: Challenge assumptions and create ideas.
4.  **Prototype**: Start to create solutions.
5.  **Test**: Try your solutions out.

## Applying it to Web Development

When building a website, don't just jump into code. Sketch out the flow. Who is this for? What are they trying to achieve? By answering these questions first, you save countless hours of rewriting code later.
