# Hello World

Welcome to my new blog! This is a space where I'll be sharing my thoughts on design, development, and everything in between.

## Why I Started Writing

I believe that writing is one of the best ways to clarify your thinking. As a designer and developer, I constantly run into interesting problems and learn new things. Documenting this journey helps me solidify my knowledge and hopefully helps others too.

## What to Expect

*   Case studies of my recent projects
*   Thoughts on modern web development (React, Tailwind, etc.)
*   Design insights and inspiration
*   Recaps of books I'm reading

Stay tuned for more!
