During the pre-iOS 26 beta hype cycle I experimented with liquid glass in the browser using Unicorn Studio.

The tool’s high level of granularity makes it easy to fine-tune how the glass reacts to different backgrounds.

### Finished product

Unicorn Studio allowed for deep manipulation of light refraction and fluid motion to mimic Apple's glassmorphism.
