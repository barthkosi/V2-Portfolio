I experimented with liquid glass in the browser using Unicorn Studio during the pre-iOS 26 beta hype cycle.

Using Unicorn Studio allowed for deep manipulation of light refraction and fluid motion to mimic Apple's glassmorphism.

The tool’s high level of granularity makes it easy to fine-tune how the glass reacts to different backgrounds.
