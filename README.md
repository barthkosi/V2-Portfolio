# V2: The Evolution of Presence

This is the second iteration of my digital portfolio. It is less of a collection of links and more of a statement of intent. The question is not what I have built, but **how the building has changed the builder.**

Version one was a foundation. Version two is...well, to be decided. In this space, I have focused on the quiet power of agency, the ability to choose tools not because they are popular, but because they allow for the highest expression of taste.

Behind the animations and the masonry layouts lies a simple truth: meaning cannot be automated. Whether it is the curation of a reading list or the presentation of a design, the goal is to set the work free and put something into the world that is worth looking at.

### Where do we go from here?

The portfolio and subsequent versions will continue to evolve. It is a living document of my growth, a record of internalizing new skills and discarding the obsolete.
